Each of the stations will have a lock

Each of the trains and passengers will have the lock 

Each of the trains will try to aquire the lock for the next station, and await on the station if not full
If the station is full, they will await until it is not full. 
    Note that the trains will notify all the threads upon ENTERING the station; this means that when the train leaves,
    all of the threads will continue to sleep

Each passenger will try to aquire the lock for the station they want to get off at. 
When they are awoken, they will attempt to try to get off of the train. 
Then, when they are in the station, when ever they get the lock, they will try to board the 
train that will take them. If the train is not in the station, or that train won't take them to their next destination, they sleep.
    In other words, when in the station, passengers will try to aquire that lock. Then, when boarding the train they will try 
    to aquire their next station's lock. 

The trains will loop through trying to move to the next station (and/or awaiting when necessary) until the sim is finished

The passengers will loop through getting off and getting on (and/or awaiting when necessary) until the they are finished with their journey

As a final note, the locks used by the trains and passengers for each "station" will be in the MBTA simulation, as locking 
on the stations will not allow the program to run concurrently with different simulations.
